    <h2>Here's a timeline of Master Funakoshi's life and accomplishments:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1868:</strong> Born in Yamakawa, Shuri, Okinawa Prefecture during the Meiji Restoration. 
    His family is of samurai lineage, vassals of Ryukyu Dynasty nobles, and opposed the Meiji government's abolition of Japanese topknots 
    (a hairstyle associated with samurai). This would prevent Funakoshi from going to medical school despite passing entrance exams, so he 
    would eventually become an assistant teacher in Okinawa.</li>

      <li><strong>1879-80:</strong> At age 11, he is recognized for his skill in Ryukyu-style martial arts and studied under Okinawan teachers
    Anko Itosu and Yasutsune Azato.</li>
    
      <li><strong>1917:</strong> Travels to mainland Japan to spark more interest among others in Okinawan karate. He would travel to the mainland 
    again five years later.</li>

      <li><strong>1922:</strong> Conducted the first ever public disply of Okinawan <em>karate-jutsu</em> in Japan at the Ministry of Education 
    (now called the Ministry of Education, Science, Sports and Culture). He would soon publish <u>Ryukyu Kempo Karate</u>, the first book ever published 
    on karate and the first of several books Funakoshi would make. The book would lead to a karate boom.</li>

      <li><strong>April 1924:</strong> Funakoshi produced the first ever "<em>Dan</em> Ranking Certification" to indicate one's level of ability in martial arts.</li>

      <li><strong>1929:</strong> Changed the name <em>karate-jutsu</em> (meaning "Chinese hand martial-art") to <em>karate-do</em> (meaning "the way of karate/the 
    way of the empty-hand") after developing a system of techniques and theory in the art, making training more accessible and easily practiced by others. A 
    practitioner of zen and enthusiast of philosophy and poetry, Funakoshi would then develop a karate philosophy called the <em>niju kun</em> ("twenty principles"), 
    which would later be published as a book called <u>Twenty Precepts of Karate</u>.</li>

      <li><strong>1930:</strong> Master Funakoshi established the Dai-Nihon Karate-do Kenkyukai association for those studying karate. This would later be renamed 
    Dai-Nippon Karate-do Shoto-kai in 1936 and then, its current name, Shotokai.</li>

      <li><strong>1935:</strong> Publishes the first edition of his book, <u>Karate Do Kyohan: Master Text for the Way of the Empty-Hand</u>.</li>

      <li><strong>1936:</strong> Funakoshi opens the first dojo in Tokyo.</li>

      <li><strong>1939:</strong> Master Funakoshi establishes the "Shotokan" dojo. The name, "Shoto", is from the master's pen name in poetry and caligraphy and 
    means "pine waves", a reference to the sound of the wind blowing through the pines sounding like ocean waves.</li>

      <li><strong>1949:</strong> After karate's growth was stopped and the Shotokan dojo was burned down due to air raids in World War II, practitioners of 
    Sensei Funakoshi's teachings formed the Japan Karate Association (JKA) with Funakoshi titled as Supreme Master.</li>

      <li><strong>April 10<sup>th</sup>, 1957:</strong> The JKA was recognized by the Ministry of Education and became a legal entity.</li>
      
      <li><strong>April 26<sup>th</sup>, 1957:</strong> Master Gichin Funakoshi passed away at 89.</li>
    </ul>
